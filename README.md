## Synopsis

This is a simple configurable alert queue for AngularJS.

## Motivation
While receiving events (from websocket, http, etc), it is sometimes beneficial to display these events to the user. To facilitate with such operations, I have constructed a simple queue service that accepts incoming events and can automatically dismiss them for you. The user can also choose to manually control the contents of the alert queue if you would prefer to do so.

## Installation
I will hopefully finish construction of this module and publish it as a bower component soon!

For now, you can run the following command to get the source code, which includes a usage example
```
git clone https://github.com/bodom0015/angular-alert.git
```
